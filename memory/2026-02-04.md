## Completed Tasks
- **Live Dashboard:** Created `dashboard.html` in `C:\Users\Boss\clawd` to provide a visual progress tracker for the "Brainrot Ascension" project.
- **Roadmap Presentation:** Delivered a 4-phase "Profit-Maximization Roadmap" to Discord user `void28451`.
- **Rojo Project Initialization:** 
    - Created `src/server`, `src/client`, `src/shared` directories.
    - Wrote `default.project.json` for Rojo syncing.
    - Implemented `src/shared/MemeMeta.lua` (rarity data).
    - Implemented `src/server/Leaderboard.server.lua` (Aura/Sigma Rank logic).
    - Implemented `src/server/GachaSystem.server.lua` (Sigma Spin logic).

## Ongoing / Blocked
- **Studio Sync:** Awaiting the user to connect Rojo in Roblox Studio to begin the actual game test.
- **Profile Picture Update:** Still pending a search key or direct link.

## Key Insights
- Using Rojo allows for autonomous code generation and organization that syncs directly into the Roblox engine.
- The 2026 Roblox meta is heavily focused on "Aura Gacha" and theft-based mechanics (Fanum Tax). 
- Trading rare units like the "Strawberry Elephant" is a major revenue driver.
