## Configuration Changes
- Primary AI engine provider changed to **Ollama** (`llama3.2:latest`).
- Secondary/Fallback provider changed to **Google Antigravity** (`gemini-3-flash`).

## Completed Tasks
- **Roblox Starter Kit:** Created and delivered a high-quality Roblox starter script (Leaderboard with DataStore persistence and a custom Tool framework) to Discord user `void28451` (ID: 856077014950608926).

## Ongoing / Blocked
- **Profile Picture Update:** Attempted to search for a new Discord profile picture but was blocked by a missing Brave Search API key. Franco was informed and asked for a direct link or a search key.
- **Roblox Game Development:** Responding to user request for "brainrot" games. Designing a "Sigma Aura Simulator" with Aura leaderboards, meme tools, and a "Fanum Tax" event. Sub-agent is currently drafting the framework and scripts.

## Lessons Learned
- Sub-agents can fail due to model timeouts or rate limits; retries or status updates to users are necessary.
- Ensure PowerShell syntax is used for file operations in the current environment.
