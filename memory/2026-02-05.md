## Completed Tasks
- **Phase 1 Core Logic:** Finalized the clicking loop (Brain Cells), Gacha system (Sigma Spins), and character visual effects (Auras).
- **Phase 2 Implementation:**
    - **Sigma City:** Created a programmatic map generator that builds a neon city with skyscrapers.
    - **Gacha Shop:** Added a physical shop with a `ProximityPrompt` and a functional Shop UI.
    - **Fanum Tax Zone:** Designed a high-risk/high-reward zone (5x click multiplier).
    - **Fanum NPC:** Scripted an AI-driven "Fanum" character that chases players in the tax zone and "taxes" (removes 20%) their current Brain Cells on contact.
- **Project Tracking:** Updated `dashboard.html` to reflect Phase 2 status.

- **Dashboard Automation:** Set up a cron job (`4b61a634-6e0c-4bfb-8ba8-3131c6ff3362`) to automatically sync the project to GitHub every 30 minutes.
- **Phase 3 Integration:** Implemented the core **Rebirth System** and updated the Leaderboard and ClickHandler to support permanent multipliers.
- **Git Initialization:** Initialized a local repository for the project and performed the first commit.

## Ongoing / Blocked
- **GitHub Link:** Awaiting the repository URL from user `void28451` to enable universal dashboard hosting via GitHub Pages.
- **Rojo Integration:** User `void28451` has successfully linked Rojo and is currently receiving live code syncs.
- **Profile Picture Update:** Still pending a search key or direct image link.

## Key Insights
- The "Fanum Tax" mechanic provides a strong "Conflict" loop, which is essential for driving future monetization via defensive boosters or shields.
- Live syncing via Rojo is working perfectly, allowing for real-time iteration of the Roblox project.
