## Completed Tasks
- **Phase 1 Core Logic:** Finalized the clicking loop (Brain Cells), Gacha system (Sigma Spins), and character visual effects (Auras).
- **Phase 2 Implementation:**
    - **Sigma City:** Created a programmatic map generator that builds a neon city with skyscrapers.
    - **Gacha Shop:** Added a physical shop with a `ProximityPrompt` and a functional Shop UI.
    - **Fanum Tax Zone:** Designed a high-risk/high-reward zone (5x click multiplier).
    - **Fanum NPC:** Scripted an AI-driven "Fanum" character that chases players in the tax zone and "taxes" (removes 20%) their current Brain Cells on contact.
- **Project Tracking:** Updated `dashboard.html` to reflect Phase 2 status.

- **Dashboard Automation:** Set up a cron job (`4b61a634-6e0c-4bfb-8ba8-3131c6ff3362`) to automatically sync the project to GitHub every 30 minutes. Successfully pushed Phase 4 logic manually.
- **Phase 4 Integration:** Implemented the **CaseOh Tsunami Event** logic, including movement, player contact penalties, and visual placeholders.
- **Git Sync Status:** Successfully pushed Phase 3 and early Phase 4 code to the repository.

## Ongoing / Blocked
- **GitHub Pages:** Still working on stable auth for GitHub Pages hosting to enable the universal dashboard.
- **Rojo Integration:** User `void28451` is receiving Phase 4 updates in real-time.

## Key Insights
- The "Fanum Tax" mechanic provides a strong "Conflict" loop, which is essential for driving future monetization via defensive boosters or shields.
- Live syncing via Rojo is working perfectly, allowing for real-time iteration of the Roblox project.
