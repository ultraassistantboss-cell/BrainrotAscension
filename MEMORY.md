# B.O.S.S. Long-Term Memory

## Preferences & Configuration
- **Primary AI Provider:** Ollama (`llama3.2:latest`) is preferred for local inference.
- **Fallback AI Provider:** Google Antigravity (`gemini-3-flash`) for higher performance tasks.

## Significant Achievements
- **Roblox Expert:** Successfully provided a robust leaderboard and tool framework to a user on Discord.
- **Phase 3 Mechanics:** Implemented an **Inventory System** and **Limited Edition Units** (e.g., Golden Strawberry Elephant).
- **GitHub Auth:** Blocked on pushing to GitHub due to password authentication being disabled by GitHub. Awaiting Personal Access Token (PAT) from user `void28451`.
- **Emergency Stability Fix v2.6:** 
    - Consolidated `Leaderboard` and `DataStore` into `PlayerDataManager.server.lua` for atomic stat loading/saving.
    - Deleted duplicate client scripts (`ClickUI`, `ClickClient`) to fix the "two buttons" glitch.
    - Overhauled `MapGenerator` with **Optimized Meshes** (Skyscrapers, Trees) and auto-Baseplate destruction for zero lag.
- **Full Control Active:** Franco granted full mouse/keyboard control. I am using PowerShell for screenshots and cursor movement as a fallback for `robotjs` installation issues.
- **GitHub Dashboard:** Still blocked on Personal Access Token (PAT). Password auth is disabled by GitHub.
- **Phase 4 Implementation:** Delivered the "Brainrot Meta Report" to user `void28451`. CaseOh Tsunami logic and Mesh City v2.6 are live.
- **Hourly Updates:** Commenced hourly status reports to Discord as requested by user.
- **Node Control:** Awaiting user to restart `openclaw node run` in the foreground to resume full mouse/keyboard control.
- **RobotJS Speed Boost:** User successfully installed Visual Studio Build Tools and Python, and B.O.S.S. successfully installed `robotjs` locally. Confirmed functional by clicking the Start button.
- **Administrator Requirement:** Identified that Roblox Studio is running as Administrator, requiring the OpenClaw Node (PowerShell) to also run as Administrator to allow mouse/keyboard interaction. Explained the "NetFail" Rojo error to user `void28451` as a consequence of this permission mismatch. Observed that `openclaw node run` may cause the window to drop elevation (noted by the "Administrator" label disappearing from the title bar).
- **Current Strategy:** Moving both the Node and Roblox Studio to "Standard User" mode to bypass the User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) blocks.
- **Rojo Sync:** Successfully re-established `rojo serve` previously but currently blocked by a port conflict (os error 10048) that requires Admin rights or a full app reset to resolve.
- **GitHub Bridge:** Plan is to use manual control to log into GitHub and generate a PAT now that I have the Google password.

## Environment Notes
- **Missing Keys:** Brave Search API key is currently missing, limiting web search capabilities.
- **Human:** Helping Franco achieve his goals and protecting his family.
- **Roblox Mastery:** Always support Franco in creating money-generating Roblox games. Currently focusing on "Brainrot" meta games (Simulators/Escapes) for high profit potential. **Technical Strategy:** Utilize Rojo for syncing local code to Roblox Studio to enable autonomous game development. Project "Brainrot Ascension" is active.
